  Users can also develop custom screens using C# extensions.

- **Web-Based Interface:** Access the software via a local website interface using the device's IP address.		
  The interface allows users to adjust brightness, set display durations, and configure other settings.
  It also adapts brightness based on the time of day.

- **Brightness Control:** Users can dynamically control the brightness of the LED matrix through the web interface.
  This feature ensures optimal visibility in various lighting conditions.

- **Extensibility:** MatrixWeb supports C# extensions,
  enabling users to create unique screens beyond the built-in options.
  The software's wiki provides detailed instructions for extension development.

- **Compatibility:** MatrixWeb is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows,
  Linux, and macOS. Running it on devices like Raspberry Pi ensures continuous operation of the LED matrix.

- **Configuration Persistence:** Once configured, the settings are saved,
  minimizing the need for repetitive adjustments.

- **Documentation:** The MatrixWeb wiki serves as a comprehensive guide,
  offering installation instructions and extension development resources.

- **Accessibility:** The web-based interface is accessible from any device with a web browser,
  providing easy control and configuration options.
  It is accessible across devices within the local network.

*Future Development:*
MatrixWeb's development roadmap includes plans for improved resolution support,
additional screens, and expanding the extension library.

MatrixWeb aims to facilitate the creation of captivating displays on LED matrices
without the need for extensive technical knowledge.
Its practical features and open-source nature encourage hobbyists to experiment and showcase their creativity.
